# Machine Learning recommender system

Repository for the Data Mining course (VU University, 2017)

## Description
We designed and trained a recommender system based on a Machine Learning approach. The algorithms are able to predict
what hotel a user is most likely to book. The whole implementation is based in Python2, using data science packages (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, ...).

The trained algorithms include:

* Random Forest regression (RF)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* LambdaMART, based on Gradient Boosted Regression trees
* Coordinate Ascent

The overall implementation is exhaustively detailed in the report included in the report directory:
